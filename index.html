						<p class="bullet-step-details">Front-end developer and architect, Aug 2015 - Present, Copenhagen</p>
						<p class="bullet-step-text">
							My work at Appstract implies different tasks, from analysing and consulting clients and designers on suggested designs, HTML, CSS, Javascript, WCAG accessibility development and testing, .net Razor, defining acceptance criteria and test scenarios for user acceptance tests,  to doing project estimations, project management and teaching the newly employed front-end developers our standards and best practices.<br/>
							The focus is on core technologies, developing lean, efficient solutions, building in-house solutions rather than using external, very generic frameworks, unless requested.<br/>
							One of the mantras at Appstract is to offer pixel-perfect, optimised and low footprint solutions targeting directly the customer needs without bloating the solutions.

						<p class="bullet-step-details">Co-founder, Jun 2015 - Jan 2017, Copenhagen</p>
						<p class="bullet-step-text">
							My first experience into the entrepreneurial world. I alongside a colleague, Elias, build the LabManager platform. My work included front-end development, designing the platform both regarding the user experience and visually, project management and business development.<br/>
							I learned a lot about developing a whole product, and about business management.

						<p class="bullet-step-details">Internship, Feb 2013 - May 2013, Copenhagen</p>
						<p class="bullet-step-text">
							I worked at Copenhagen Records as part of my internship. I helped design mobile and tablet interface for Musik.dk.<br/> 
							It was a very challenging experience, as I was at the beginning of my front-end journey. But thanks to the pressure and responsabilities I learned many things which later brought me to Appstract.

				<ul class="bullet-step-list">
					<li class="bullet-step-item">
						<h3 class="bullet-step-title">Continuous learning</h3>
						<p class="bullet-step-text">
							We live in a very fast changing world. In fact, 20 years ago, my job didn't exist. And it won't be the same in another 20.<br/>
							As of the last 4 years, I have read on average a book each month, from business and psychology to development and technical ones.
						</p>
						<span class="bullet-step-dot"></span>
					</li>
					<li class="bullet-step-item">
						<h3 class="bullet-step-title">High quality work</h3>
						<p class="bullet-step-text">
							When I am taking on a project, work related or not, my end goal is not only to finish the project, but to make the recipient, client or friend happy.<br/>
							Sometimes it is a small animation or a quick loading time. Othertimes it is a good conversation, trying to better understand the other person. Or helping them with a difficulty.<br/>
							In the end, for me, projects are not things to finish and move on, but bridges to get to know and help other people.
						</p>
						<span class="bullet-step-dot"></span>
					</li>
					<li class="bullet-step-item">
						<h3 class="bullet-step-title">A better tomorrow</h3>
						<p class="bullet-step-text">
							I believe we are all responsible for the world we live in. And this gives us the power to make it better.<br/>
							While we are not super-heroes and we can't save the world alone, we can improve it together.<br/>
							In my case, I helped organise camps for highschool children and I taught public speaking.<br/>
							In university I was part of different activism groups working towards a better, cleaner environment.<br/>
							Today I am working on downsizing my negative footprint on the world, by having less material belongings and by giving up completly my old car.
						</p>
						<span class="bullet-step-dot"></span>
					</li>
					<li class="bullet-step-item">
						<h3 class="bullet-step-title">Honesty and transparency</h3>
						<p class="bullet-step-text">
							I consider the two as foundation for healthy, positive relations with anyone around ourselves, family, friends and clients.<br/>
							Giving creative, helpful criticism and being open has proved to be the solution in many possibly problematic situations.
						</p>
						<span class="bullet-step-dot"></span>
					</li>
					<li class="bullet-step-item">
						<h3 class="bullet-step-title">Family</h3>
						<p class="bullet-step-text">
							Family for me is the cornerstone of personal values, of relations and of us as people. Within our families we form as persons, we take on values and we put them into practice.<br/>
							The workplace, the colleagues, the clients, are in a way also part of the family. And they reflect just as much on ourselves.<br/>
							As such, I try to be as helpful, as honest, as open with everyone as I would be with my family. To treat others as I want to be treated.
						</p>
						<span class="bullet-step-dot"></span>
					</li>
					<li class="bullet-step-item">
						<h3 class="bullet-step-title">Customer experience</h3>
						<p class="bullet-step-text">
							When clients choose a company, I learned that they are not looking only for great developers, a great end project, but many times for partners.<br/>
							If a product is great, even perfect, but the personal relation with the client was lacking, it rarely matters. On the other hand, even if there were issues during a project, but the dialogue with the client was open, they could come back.<br/>
							And just as anyone else, I love when I receive great service. So whenever I have the chance, I do my best to do the same.
						</p>
						<span class="bullet-step-dot"></span>
					</li>
					<li class="bullet-step-item">
						<h3 class="bullet-step-title">Experiencing the world</h3>
						<p class="bullet-step-text">
							The world is an amazing place full of diversity. And with diversity comes a wide range of ideas, solutions, possibilities.<br/>
							I love travelling, seeing new places, meeting new people, making a connection, learning the differences and enjoying them. Because from them some of the best ideas and solutions come to life.<br/>

				<div class="rich-text">
					<p>Hi. Welcome to the last part, myself.</p>

					<p>I'll be honest, this is the hardest part. I am not very good at describing myself. It always felt a bit strange but here it goes.</p>

					<p>I am a simple guy. I am a geek. I love to play with a new gadget, a smartphone, a new tech or a new framework.</p>

					<p>I love experiences, from taking a stroll in a park with my awesome wife, to hanging out or playing games with our friends and travelling all around the world.</p>

					<p>I love my wife! A lot!</p>

					<p>I grew up in a normal family, in Romania, and I moved to Denmark for university. I learned that we are responsible for our own actions and the world around us. And that is cool because that means we have the power to make it awesome!</p>

					<p>I am an eternal optimist, looking towards the future, but trying to figure out how can I give a helping hand to make a better tomorrow.</p>
